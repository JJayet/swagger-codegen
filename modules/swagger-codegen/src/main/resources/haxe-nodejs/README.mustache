# Swagger Haxe Express generated server

## Overview
This haxe express server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  By using the [swagger-spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This is an example of building a node.js server via haxe.

This example uses the [expressjs](http://expressjs.com/) framework.  To see how to make this your own, look here:

[README](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/README.md)

### Running the server
To run the server, follow these simple steps:

```
npm install
node api.js
```

To view the Swagger UI interface:

```
open http://localhost:3000/doc
```

This project leverages the mega-awesome [swagger-tools](https://github.com/apigee-127/swagger-tools) middleware which does most all the work.
